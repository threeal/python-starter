# Python Starter

A minimalist template for starting a new [Python](https://www.python.org/) project.

This template provides a basic Python project containing an example package with built-in support for formatting, linting, testing, and continuous integration.

## Key Features

* Uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the package manager.
* Supports formatting and linting with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), and testing with [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
* Fixes formatting and linting during pre-commit hooks using [Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/).
* Preconfigured workflows for [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
