## About This Repository

A minimal Python library and CLI starter template. Its only application code is a placeholder Fibonacci implementation in `src/` — real logic is added by projects derived from it.

## Gotchas

- `lefthook run pre-commit` skips every job when nothing is staged, even ones that ignore the staged file list — pass `--all-files` to run it outside an actual commit.
- The pre-commit hook fixes files in place, and the run fails if any file changes. Report that failure and leave the fixes for the user to review and re-stage before committing again.
- The test command is `uv run pytest --cov`, not `uv run pytest` — only `--cov` applies the 100% coverage threshold from `pyproject.toml`.
- `.gitignore` ignores every dotfile and dotdir (`.*`) — a new one needs an explicit `!` exception there or it silently won't be tracked.
